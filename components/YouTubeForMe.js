                Creating YouTube videos has forced me to understand programming
                concepts better, learn about marketing and design, build a
                personal brand, and so much more. It takes a lot more than just
                writing a few lines of code.

                You'll learn more from creating YouTube videos than you ever did
                watching them!

                My YouTube channel is something I proudly display on my own
                resume as a testament to my skills, hard work, and passion. I
                never would have thought that YouTube would lead to so many
                opportunities, but I don't think the following would have been
                possible without it.
